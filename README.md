This repository accompanies the blog post [Leveraging MCPs with LLMs](https://diegulio.github.io/posts/mcp/main.html).

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate Multi-Command Processors (MCPs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate workflows such as extracting YouTube video transcripts and formatting content for Notion. It includes:

- Python scripts for MCP server and tool definitions
- Example Jupyter Notebook for orchestrating LLM and MCP interactions

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies listed in your Python environment.
3. Run the MCP server (`main.py`) or interact with it using the provided notebook (`main_llm.ipynb`).

See the [blog post](https://diegulio.github.io/posts/mcp/main.html) for a detailed walkthrough and explanation.
